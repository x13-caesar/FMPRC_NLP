# New China Newspeak

This is a project to deconstruct the "New China Newspeak" (a.k.a. 新华文体). 

Geremie R. Barmé, wrote in [*CHINA HERITAGE QUARTERLY No. 29, March 2012*](http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/glossary.php?searchterm=029_xinhua.inc&issue=029):
> New China Newspeak is an accumulation of written and spoken styles of Chinese, it reflects both an impoverishment as well as an elaboration of Chinese as a communicative tool; it overlaps but is not quite the same as the 'formalized language of Chinese politics' so aptly discussed elsewhere.
